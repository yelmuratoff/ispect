## Data redaction

Sensitive data is automatically masked before it reaches logs or observers. Redaction is **enabled by default** — built-in rules cover auth headers, tokens, passwords, API keys, cookies, PII (SSN, passport, driver's license), financial data (credit cards, IBAN), phone numbers, and more.

Redaction is a safety layer, not a substitute for data minimization. Prefer disabling body/header capture when payload contents are not needed, and add project-specific keys for business identifiers that only your application understands.

### Custom keys and patterns

```dart
import 'package:ispectify/ispectify.dart';

final redactor = RedactionService(
  sensitiveKeys: {
    ...defaultSensitiveKeys,
    'x-custom-secret',
    'internal_token',
  },
  sensitiveKeyPatterns: [
    RegExp(r'my_app_secret_\w+', caseSensitive: false),
  ],
  // Keys where the value is replaced entirely (not edge-masked).
  fullyMaskedKeys: {'filename'},
  placeholder: '***',
  visibleEdgeLength: 3,
  redactBinary: true,
  redactBase64: true,
);
```

### Ignoring defaults

```dart
final redactor = RedactionService(
  // e.g., ?mobile=true is a platform flag, not a phone number.
  ignoredKeys: {'mobile', 'platform_token'},
  ignoredValues: {'<test-token>', 'public-api-key'},
);
```

### Disabling

Each interceptor accepts `enableRedaction: false` on its settings object. See the per-package README for the exact settings type.

Only disable redaction in isolated local or deterministic test environments. Exported sessions and observer events should be treated as sensitive artifacts even when redaction is enabled.

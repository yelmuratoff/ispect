## Data redaction

Sensitive data is masked before it reaches logs or observers. Redaction is on by default. The built-in rules cover auth headers, tokens, passwords, API keys, cookies, common PII (SSN, passport, driver's license), financial data (credit cards, IBAN), and phone numbers.

The default policy is a single source of truth. Configure it once and core logs, traces, persistence, network and database adapters, BLoC and Riverpod observers, supported exports, clipboard helpers, and cURL generation resolve it when each diagnostic operation runs.

Redaction works best paired with deliberate capture. Use the integration's `metadataOnly()` or compact preset when payload values are unnecessary, and register project-specific keys for the business identifiers only your application understands.

### Global configuration

```dart
import 'package:ispectify/ispectify.dart';

ISpectRedaction.configure(
  service: RedactionService(
    additionalSensitiveKeys: {
      'x-custom-secret',
      'internal_token',
    },
    additionalSensitiveKeyPatterns: [
      RegExp(r'my_app_secret_\w+', caseSensitive: false),
    ],
    fullyMaskedKeys: {'filename'},
    placeholder: '***',
    visibleEdgeLength: 3,
  ),
);
```

`additionalSensitiveKeys` and `additionalSensitiveKeyPatterns` extend the built-in policy. Use `sensitiveKeys` or `sensitiveKeyPatterns` only when you intentionally want to replace the corresponding defaults:

```dart
final replacementPolicy = RedactionService(
  sensitiveKeys: {
    'x-custom-secret',
    'internal_token',
  },
  sensitiveKeyPatterns: [
    RegExp(r'my_app_secret_\w+', caseSensitive: false),
  ],
);
```

Flutter apps can pass the same policy as `ISpect.run(redactionService: ...)`; `ISpect.dispose()` restores the policy that was active before that run. An explicit `RedactionService` supplied to one integration stays local and takes precedence over the global policy. Existing integrations without an explicit service pick up later global reconfiguration. The policy is scoped to the current Dart isolate.

### Local exceptions

```dart
final redactor = RedactionService(
  ignoredKeys: {'mobile', 'platform_token'},
  ignoredValues: {'<test-token>', 'public-api-key'},
);
```

### Disabling

`ISpectRedaction.configure(enabled: false)` is the global content-masking opt-out. Each interceptor also accepts `enableRedaction: false` on its settings object for a local opt-out. Size limits, non-executing snapshots, private-storage checks, and the compile-time `ISPECT_ENABLED` gate remain enforced.

Only disable redaction in isolated local or deterministic test environments. Exported sessions and observer events should be handled according to the data they contain.
